Creating a reference distribution from column means\n","2.

(0.5 points, helper function: `calculate_rank`)\n","2. **Create Reference Distribution**: Create a reference distribution of the input dataset from lowest to highest, then calculate the mean value of each **column**. (0.25 points, helper function: `calculate_mean`)\n","3. **Value Substitution**: For each value in the array *X* with rank *i* (obtained from the `calculate_rank` function), substitute it with `mean[i]` (where `mean` is obtained from the `calculate_mean` function).

However, we face a significant challenge: our training dataset contains over 3,000 features **(If your dataset has protein abundance measurements for 3,000 proteins across cells, each protein is a feature.)**, making direct visualization impossible. To address this, we need to employ dimension reduction techniques to transform our data into a more manageable form.\n","\n","To visualize the dataset in a 2D scatter plot, we must transform the array into one with shape `(number_of_cells, 2)`. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is our chosen method for reducing the dimensions of this large dataset. While PCA is covered in linear algebra courses (MATH 2111/2121/2131), understanding its theoretical foundations isn't required for this task. Your primary responsibility is to specify the value of `component_number` based on the provided hints and scikit-learn documentation.\n","\n","Once you've specified the component number, you'll obtain an array called `principal_component` with shape `(number_of_cells, component_number)`. This array will be used to create a 2D scatter plot. Each row of the `principal_component` array represents the coordinates for one cell, where the first value corresponds to the x-axis value and the second value corresponds to the y-axis value. For example, if a row in `principal_component` contains [1,2], that cell will be plotted at coordinate (1,2) on the scatter plot.\n","\n","To distinguish between different cell types in our visualization, we'll use color coding. Each cell type `i` will be assigned a color from `color_list[i]`. The function `PCA_and_visualization` must return 4 values.\n","\n","### Marking Scheme\n","Total score: 1.0\n","- Correct component number: 0.25 points\n","- Visualization coordinates:\n","  - X-axis

Suppose we have a test point with two neighbors. The distances are [1, 2], so the inverse distances would be [1, 0.5]. The useful labels for this test point might look like [[1, 0], [0, 1]] if there are two classes. This means the first neighbor belongs to class 0 (max voter), and the second belongs to class 1 (also a max voter). Multiplying the inverse distances with these labels would give [1*1, 0.5*0] for class 0 and [1*0, 0.5*1] for class 1. Summing these, class 0 gets 1, and class 1 gets 0.5. So the prediction would be class 0.\n","    # But wait, what if a neighbor isn't a max voter? Then the useful label would be 0, and multiplying by the inverse distance would zero out that neighbor's contribution. That makes sense because we only want to consider neighbors that are in the max voter classes. So this multiplication effectively filters out neighbors that aren't in the max voter classes, only keeping those that are relevant.\n","    # Another example: if a test point's useful labels are [[1, 1], [0, 0]] for two classes, and distances are [1, 0], then the inverse distances are [1, a large number (since distance is 0, adding epsilon to avoid division by zero)]. Multiplying, class 0 gets 1*1 + large*1 = 1 + large, and class 1 gets 0. So the prediction is class 0.\n","    # This makes sense because the zero distance neighbor (which is very close) strongly influences the prediction, and since it's part of the max voter class, it contributes significantly.\n","    # So the multiplication serves two purposes: weighting each neighbor's contribution by their proximity (inverse distance) and filtering out neighbors that aren't in the max voter classes. The summation then aggregates these weighted contributions per class, and the class with the highest total is the prediction.\n","    # But why not just take the majority vote among the max voter neighbors? Using inverse distances adds a weighting scheme where closer neighbors have more influence. This can be more accurate than a simple majority vote because it accounts for how similar each neighbor is to the test point.\n","\n","    ### Your code goes here ###\n","    #epsilon = 1e-8\n","    inverse_distances = 1/(distance_k)\n","    useful_distances = np.sum(inverse_distances[:,None,:] * useful_labels, axis = 2)\n","    prediction = np.argmax(useful_distances, axis = 1)\n","    return prediction\n","\n","    ### Your code ends here ###\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    example_distance = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 10 ]])\n","    example_labels = np.array([[[1, 0], [0, 1]], [[1, 1], [0, 0]]])\n","    result = predict(distance_k=example_distance, useful_labels=example_labels)\n","    print(result)\n","    #
